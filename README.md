# Fresco Italian Restaurant Website (Static)

A modern Italian restaurant website built in WordPress (Elementor) and exported as a **static site** for fast, secure hosting on **Netlify**.  
Includes a responsive landing page, featured menu section, testimonials, and contact/reservation CTAs.

- Contact / Reservations

## Tech Stack
- WordPress (local development)
- Elementor (page builder)
- Simply Static (export to HTML)
- HTML / CSS / JS (static output)
- GitHub (version control)

## How This Repo Works
This repository contains the **exported static files** (HTML/CSS/JS/assets).  
WordPress is used only during development to design and manage content, then the site is exported for deployment.

## Run Locally
Option 1: Open directly
1. Download the repo ZIP or clone it
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

Option 2: Use a local server (recommended)
```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# then open
http://localhost:8080
